RFC: Single Sign On (SSO)
###################

Since care professionals sometimes work on the same patients for several care 
organizations using different software vendors, their daily work can greatly be
improved when they can reuse their identity between these software applications.
Therefor we propose here a way of Single-Sign-On (SSO) using the techniques
present in a Nuts node.

This document builds on Login Contracts and the RFC on Session Tokens.
