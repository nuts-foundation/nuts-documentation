Welcome to the Nuts Getting Started guide. Nuts can help you with mainly two
common challenges in data exchange between Care Providers:

* Getting data from another party with consent from the patient
* Providing data to another party with consent from the patient

Some parties need to support only one use-ase, others need both.

Whatever your situation is, you always need to setup your Nuts node first.

This tutorial will help you with:

* :ref:`Setting up a local Nuts network <Setup a local Nuts network>`
* :ref:`Letting a user identify itself <Let users authenticate themselves to the Nuts network>`
* :ref:`Record a patients consent <Let patients record their consent>`
* :ref:`Validate incoming api request <Validate incoming api requests>`
