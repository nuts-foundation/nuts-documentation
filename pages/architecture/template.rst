Architecture documentation guidelines
#####################################

Architectural documentation gives a high level overview of Nuts components. The sections below give an explanation on how to write good architectural documentation.

Target audience
***************

Your target audience should be architects and open-source contributors/component developers.

Should include
**************

The documentation should include high level diagrams on how components work together. Also design decisions that have impact on the technical specification and implementation can be added to the architectural documentation. Links to or snippets from relevant legal documentation might be added when they influence the overall architecture.

Should not include
******************

The architectural documentation should not include technical documentation like specifications, flow diagrams, standards and links to code repositories.

Where to place
**************

Architectural documentation that covers multiple components should be places in the ``nuts-documentation`` repository. If it documents the architecture of a specific components, it should be placed in the repository of the component under ``docs/pages/architecture/``. This will be automatically added to the main documentation.
